This simulation is designed to run under Gromacs-2019.6. Before execution, please ensure the relevant script paths and parameters are correctly configured.

First, build the model. Use Packmol to add 100 CO2 and 100 N2 molecules in the feed side,perform energy minimization first, and then run a 1 ns NVT process to obtain 1.gro. 
Select the gas molecule closest to both ends of the membrane, and use their z coordinates as the coordinates for local_zr and local_zl in the CGMD-3.py file. Rename 1.gro to start.gro. Adjust the parameters in CGMD-3.py as well as the path in 55-gaijin.sh, then run the script to start the simulation.
